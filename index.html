            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We are a small 3D indie game studio based in Geelong, VIC. Since 2015, we’ve been creating fun and
                exciting game worlds for players to explore. Our team has grown to 15 talented and creative people who
                love making games.
                We believe games are more than just fun — they can tell great stories, bring people together, and create
                amazing adventures. Every game we make is built with care, imagination, and a lot of teamwork.
                Our goal is to build worlds that players remember. Whether you’re solving puzzles, fighting monsters, or
                discovering new places, we want every moment in our games to be special.
                Come join us as we continue to make games full of creativity, fun, and heart.
